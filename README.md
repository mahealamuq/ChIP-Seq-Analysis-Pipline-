# ChIP-Seq-Analysis-Pipline
Complete ChIP-seq analysis pipeline using FastQC, Bowtie2, SAMtools, MACS2, IGV, and MEME Suite for peak calling, visualization, and motif analysis.

This repository contains a complete ChIP-seq bioinformatics workflow for identifying genome-wide protein–DNA binding sites. The pipeline includes sequencing quality control, read alignment with Bowtie2, BAM processing with SAMtools, peak calling using MACS2, visualization in IGV, and motif discovery using MEME Suite and FIMO.

The workflow is designed for transcription factor ChIP-seq experiments comparing antibody-enriched samples against input/control samples.
